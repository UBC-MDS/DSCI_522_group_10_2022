# Code of Conduct

## Diversity and Inclusion

All members and contributors of this project look to engage with the community in a manner that is positive and with open minds to encourage collaboration and improve access to information. We strive to have an environment that captures diversity and inclusivity by ensuring that no stigmas or discrimination exists within our team or work. We pledge to ensure that the work completed is open, honest and ethically  sustainable.

## Expected Behaviour

- **Open to collaboration and ideas.** Improvement comes from many different channels and is not a singular effort. We will be open to all forms of feedback and be transparent with how we work with the community. Collaboration not only encourages growth, but it also helps to promote inclusion and acceptance.
- **Being respectful of others.** Feelings of trust and safety stem from sharing respect with others. We strive to have a team that is respectful to all beliefs and levels of knowledge ensuring no one is left uncomfortable or feeling attacked.
- **Taking responsibility.** Mistakes can be made and it is our job to ensure that we first listen and understand what went wrong in order to correct it. We look to be transparent to ensure those mistakes are not repeated.
- **Being open and understanding.** There are many different aspects to the community that are not always evident. It is our job to be understanding and open to these facets such that we can incorporate inclusion into our work.

## Unaccepted Behaviour

 Our goal is to have a feeling of safety and inclusion within the community. Which includes people of different races and backgrounds, sexual orientations, gender orientations, religions, cultures, ethnic groups, and ages. **Any form of personal discrimination, harassment, or violence will not be tolerated.**
This includes, but is not limited to:

- Personal attacks in the form of hurtful or discriminatory language including racist or sexist comments
- Jokes or off-hand comments that are discriminate in nature
- Threatening or intimidating others with sexually explicit or violent actions
- Use of discriminatory or sexual media
- Inappropriate physical or sexual interactions/attention

Any breach in violation of unaccepted behaviour will be met with respective consequences. Any form of physical or sexual violence/acts will be reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency. Any form of abusive or discriminatory language will be recorded and reported to the appropriate authority.

## Procedure for Reporting Breaches of CoC
